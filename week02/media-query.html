            <h2>1 Nefi 1:1</h2>
            <p>I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my
                father; and having seen many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly
                favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries
                of God, therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days.</p>

            <h2>1 Nefi 4:1</h2>
            <p>1 And it came to pass that I spake unto my brethren, saying: Let us go up again unto Jerusalem, and let
                us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord; for behold he is mightier than all the earth,
                then why not mightier than Laban and his fifty, yea, or even than his tens of thousands?</p>
